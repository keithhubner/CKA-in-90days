# Introduction 

Learning in public is a great way to ensure you actually complete something, but also a way to work with a community to help other people on the same journey. The goal of this project is to work through tasks and content required to pass the CKA exam in 90days and hopefully help some other people on the same journey. 

I've broken the days down into the sections aligned with the [exam curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_v1.24.pdf). The content for each day should take no longer than an hour to complete. This should allow anyone following this guide to go at their own pace. 

This project is a work in progress as I go through the learning content. I have purposely only used references to the official Kubernetes, this will be most useful when taking the exam and a reliable source of information. 

## What you should know already

This guide is focussed on what you need to know to pass the CKA. However anyone following this guide should have a good understanding of the following:
