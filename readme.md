# Introduction 

Learning in public is a great way to ensure you actually complete something, but also a way to work with a community to help other people on the same journey. The goal of this project is to work through tasks and content required to pass the CKA exam in 90days and hopefully help some other people on the same journey. 

I've broken the days down into the sections aligned with the [exam curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/blob/master/CKA_Curriculum_v1.24.pdf). The content for each day should take no longer than an hour to complete. This should allow anyone following this guide to go at their own pace.
